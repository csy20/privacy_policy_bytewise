        <h1>Privacy Policy for ByteWise</h1>
        <p class="meta">Effective Date: 15 December 2025</p>

        <p><strong>ByteWise</strong> ("the app") is a learning application that provides structured courses on Data Structures & Algorithms, System Design, and Git/Version Control. This document explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices users have regarding their personal data.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>ByteWise is designed as an offline educational resource. The app does not require user registration, does not track individual usage, and does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or device identifiers.</p>
        <p>All course content is bundled with the app in the form of markdown files and is rendered locally on your device.</p>
        <p>We do not integrate analytics or advertising services, and we do not access sensitive device data such as contacts, location, camera, or microphone.</p>
        <p>The only data we may collect is minimal, anonymous diagnostic information if the app crashes; this is used solely to improve stability and fix bugs.</p>
        
        <h3>Crash and Log Data</h3>
        <p>If the app encounters an unexpected error, anonymised crash reports may be generated. These reports contain technical information about the error (e.g., stack trace, device model, and OS version). They do not contain any personal data. Crash data is used only to diagnose and improve the app's performance.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the limited information described above to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain and improve the app:</strong> Crash reports help us identify and resolve software issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Respond to user enquiries:</strong> If you contact us for support, we may collect your email address or other contact details in order to respond.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will not use this information for marketing and will not share it with third parties. We do not use or share any information for advertising, profiling, or other purposes beyond those necessary to operate and maintain ByteWise.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>ByteWise does not share personal or sensitive data with third parties. We do not sell, trade, or rent user information.</p>
        <p>The only third-party components used in the app are open-source Flutter packages (e.g., provider, flutter_markdown, google_fonts) that assist with rendering content and managing state. These packages do not collect or transmit user data.</p>
        <p>If we are required by law to disclose information (e.g., to comply with a valid governmental request), we will do so only to the extent required and will notify users when legally permitted.</p>

        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the integrity of the app and any information transmitted to us. However, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Because ByteWise does not store personal data, the risk associated with using the app is minimal.</p>
        <p>Should we ever implement online features in the future, we will use industry-standard security measures such as HTTPS/TLS encryption to safeguard information in transit and encryption for data at rest.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>ByteWise is designed for users of all ages, including students. Since the app does not collect any personally identifiable information, it does not knowingly solicit data from children under the age of 13. Parents or guardians who believe that a child has provided us with personal information may contact us so that we can delete such information.</p>

        <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
        <p>Because ByteWise does not collect or store personal data, there is no personal information to access, rectify, or delete.</p>
        <p>If we begin collecting personal data in the future, we will update this privacy policy accordingly and provide mechanisms to exercise rights under applicable data protection laws (e.g., the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, and data portability under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and comparable rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)).</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or applicable regulations. When we do, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this document and provide a prominent notice within the app or on our listing page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
